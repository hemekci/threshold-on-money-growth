## Overview

This repository provides complete replication materials for analyzing threshold effects of money growth on inflation in G20 countries (1999–2023). We apply Hansen's (2017) regression kink methodology to identify non-linear monetary transmission mechanisms.

**Key Finding:** Money growth exhibits a threshold effect on inflation—the relationship changes at a specific threshold level of money growth.

## Methodology

### Hansen's Regression Kink Model

**Model Specification:**
```
Yₜ = β₀ + ρYₜ₋₁ + β₁₋(Xₜ - γ)₋ + β₁₊(Xₜ - γ)₊ + εₜ
```

Where:
- `Yₜ` = Inflation rate (GDP deflator) in year t
- `Yₜ₋₁` = Lagged inflation (captures inflation persistence)
- `ρ` = Coefficient of inflation persistence
- `Xₜ` = Excess money growth (M3 growth minus real GDP growth) in year t
- `γ` = Kink point/threshold parameter (estimated)
- `(Xₜ - γ)₋` = Negative deviations from the kink point γ
- `(Xₜ - γ)₊` = Positive deviations from the kink point γ
- `β₀` = Constant term
- `β₁₋` = Coefficient when excess money growth is below the threshold
- `β₁₊` = Coefficient when excess money growth exceeds the threshold
- `εₜ` = Error term

**Interpretation:**
- The slope changes at the threshold γ
- Below threshold: inflation responds with slope β₁₋
- Above threshold: inflation responds with slope β₁₊
- Non-linear monetary transmission identified

**Estimation:**
- Least squares based estimation with concentration and grid search (0-40% range)
- Method selects kink value minimizing sum of squared residuals
- Bootstrap method for hypothesis testing (non-standard asymptotics)

**Testing for Kink Effect:**

F-test statistic:
```
F*ₖ = [SSEₖ₀ - SSEₖ₁(γ̂)] / [SSEₖ₁(γ̂)/(T - 1)]
```

Where SSEₖ₀ is sum of squared errors under null (linear model), SSEₖ₁(γ̂) under alternative (one kink model), and T is number of observations.

## Results

### Main Output File: `results/growth.out`

Contains:
1. **Linear Model** (baseline)
   - Coefficient βₘ₃ₐ = 0.37 (SE = 0.093, p < 0.01)
   - Inflation persistence ρ = 0.62 (SE = 0.064)
   - Constant β₀ = -0.65 (SE = 0.504)

2. **Threshold Model** (Hansen's Regression Kink)
   - Estimated threshold γ̂ = 18.20% (SE = 2.824)
   - Below threshold: β₁₋ = 0.16 (SE = 0.045)
   - Above threshold: β₁₊ = 0.75 (SE = 0.194)
   - Inflation persistence ρ = 0.54 (SE = 0.070)
   - Constant β₀ = 3.88 (SE = 0.997)

3. **Hypothesis Tests**
   - F-test for kink effect: p-value = 0.003 (10,000 bootstrap replications)
   - Strong rejection of null hypothesis (linear model)
   - Confirms presence of threshold effect

4. **Key Findings**
   - Asymmetric monetary transmission identified
   - Modest inflationary impact below threshold (β₁₋ = 0.16)
   - Sharply amplified effect above threshold (β₁₊ = 0.75)
   - Critical threshold at 18.2% excess money growth
